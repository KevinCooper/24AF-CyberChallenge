BSD-derived versions of telnet are vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploit available in Metasploit.
Solaris 9 could not be found to be confirmed as vulnerable, however, it likely is.
These are of interest using telnet_encrypt_keyid exploit.
Can also scan first before exploiting with telnet_encrypt_overflow.

172.17.50.143
172.17.50.188
172.17.50.202

This shows as running BSD-derived telnet but OS was not determined on our scan:
